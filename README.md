## 1. Executive Summary

Key Findings:

1️⃣ Market Position: One OTA has emerged as the second-largest player in Germany’s hotel booking market, showcasing the highest competitive growth in the sector.

The hotel function was built as a subsidiary company after Covid-19. This strategic move aimed to capitalize on evolving travel demands and strengthen its position in the OTA market.
